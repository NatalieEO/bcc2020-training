// When a pipeline script is launched, Nextflow looks for this nextflow.config file.
// This file defines settings and properties and can be organized into different scopes.

// The manifest scope lets you define some metadata.
// The settings available are author, description, defaultBranch, homePage, mainScript, name, nextflowVersion, and version
manifest {

    description = 'This workflow will print a hello message and store it to a file named Hello.txt'

// You may need to update some inputs with your own local path.
params {

// The docker scope controls how Docker containers are executed by Nextflow.
// Here, we enable it to true so that our workflow executes on the Docker container we defined by default.
